## Introduction
**The Giving Garden** is a cozy social simulation RPG. You play as the main character and as the village's helping hand. Scavenge for items, craft gifts, and interact with the community. Craft and gift items to the villagers while you enjoy the scenic views, the sounds and scents of nature, and form a strong sense of community. Experience a simpler and less stressful life by immersing yourself in this heart-warming game.

## Our Mission
Our game's mission is to help high stress employees de-stress. Players play at their own pace and are immersed into a simpler time where they gift goods to a community. We balance excitement with difficulty by allowing players to decide what level difficulty they would like to play on. We were inspired by nature to further reinforce our focus on mental health.
